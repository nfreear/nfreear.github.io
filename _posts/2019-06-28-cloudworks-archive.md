<!--
On Friday 28 June 2019 I put [Cloudworks][] into readonly mode, closing a chapter
on this 10 year old web-site.
-->

The _Cloudworks_ web-site was launched at the end of 2009,
and 10 years later at the end of June 2019, we have closed the [original site][cloudworks].
and created a [read-only archive version][arch] instead.

_Why is this?_

Cloudworks was developed as part of the [JISC][]-funded [OULDI][] research project.

![Screen shot of Cloudworks prototype - July 2008][screen-2008]

It was a dynamic web-site, developed by [Juliette Culver][jc] using PHP and the [CodeIgniter][] framework.
This enabled visitors to register, login, create _clouds_, and comment and contribute to other people's _clouds_.

It has been a very successful site, used for countless [OU and external conferences and workshops][ev],
for [IET][]'s [H818-2014][H818] e-learning course, work-related blogging, and many other uses.

The [OULDI][] funding, and [Grainne's][gc] and [Rebecca Galley's][rg] fantastic
curation and promotion lead to wide and consistent use within the
_learning design_ and e-learning communities.
As the original team have moved on to other roles, and the [LTT][] team have
worked on other projects, the original web-site has become less sustainable.

There has been no recent targeted funding, so that we have run the servers,
patched the software, and _kept the lights on_ with IET _base-line_ funding.
(_Note, this is a common scenario for web-sites developed as part of research projects._)

![Screen shot 2 of Cloudworks  - June 2019][screen-2019]

In recent years usage of the site has dwindled (with [notable exceptions][h818]),
while spam has become an increasing problem.
(_The original social and community strengths of the site have encouraged spam._)

The original [CodeIgniter][]-based site is showing its age, with the potential for security holes increasing.
And, our recent work on [GDPR][] has focussed our minds on moth-balling sites that we judge to be unsustainable.

_Cloudworks unfortunately falls into this category._

We haven't made the decision lightly, and we hope that this read-only archive of
static HTML pages will continue to provide a valuable resource,
while minimizing security and other risks.

...

I hope to follow up this post with some Cloudworks statistics.
