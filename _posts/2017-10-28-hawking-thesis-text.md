Dear University of Cambridge,

Congratulations on publishing [Stephen Hawkings' PhD thesis, "_Properties of expanding universes_" online][search].
I along with many others salute your commitment to [open access][oa]!

However, I'm a little disappointed that alongside the [PDF of the scanned thesis][pdf],
there isn't a text version available.

There are some important reasons to create a text version:

 1. [Accessibility to those with dis-abilities][a11y],
 2. Searchability,
 3. Access by those on low-bandwidth connections (_the scanned PDF is ~20 MB_).

I believe the above points relate to Cambridge University's adoption of
the [FAIR principles][fair], as mentioned in the [terms of use][].
Note that while the use of "_accessible_" in the FAIR principles does not
directly relate to the term used in relation to dis-abilities,
the FAIR principles particularly "_findable_" and "_interoparable_"
correlate to some extent with the [POUR principles within WCAG 2.1][wcag21].

I think my point is particularly appropriate, given that Stephen Hawking
himself relies on a wheel-chair and other assistive technologies.

A useful first step would be to publish the abstract, table of contents,
and extended meta-data (including license) in HTML/ text format.

Note, if you're publishing a research output or similar work as a text-based PDF,
then you should look at [tagged PDF][t-pdf] (for accessibility),
and [PDF/A][] (archive) for long-term preservation.

Here is Hawking's _thesis abstract_ (via Google Scholar and the [British Library][bl]):

> Some implications and consequences of the expansion of the universe are examined.
> In Chapter 1 it is shown that this expansion creates grave difficulties for the Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravitation.
> Chapter 2 deals with perturbations of an expanding homogeneous and isotropic universe.
> The conclusion is reached that galaxies cannot be formed as a result of the growth of perturbations that were initially small.
> The propagation and absorption of gravitational radiation is also investigated in this approximation.
> In Chapter 3 gravitational radiation in an expanding universe is examined by a method of asymptotic expansions.
> The 'peeling off' behaviour and the asymptotic group are derived.
> Chapter 4 deals with the occurrence of singularities in cosmological models.
> It is shown that a singularity is inevitable provided that certain very general conditions are satisfied.

And, here's a [tweet][] on the subject.

Yours,

_P.S._ Full disclosure. I write this fully accepting that my own
[PhD thesis][ndf-thesis] is currently only available as a scanned PDF.
I need to change this!
(However, my thesis has negligible or zero scientific or cultural importance,
when compared with the work of Stephen Hawking ;).)
