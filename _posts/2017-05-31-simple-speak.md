I've been continuing with the burst of activity that led to the [gaad-widget][],
and a re-booted [sign-machine][].
_(In the case of `sign-machine`, it was desirable to produce a quick prototype, then judge the reaction, if any.)_

Ever since I worked for a speech technology company ([Aurix][]), then
discovered screen readers, I've been interested in and fascinated by speech synthesisers.

When [I wrote a book on Moodle][book], one of the plugins I developed
[enabled speech synthesis in Moodle][mdl-p].
Unfortunately, the web services that it relies on seem to no longer be avilable,
and it has languished. <!-- .. I haven't had the time to maintain that plugin -->

I'm happy to say that the Web has moved on since then.
With the evolution of HTML5, we now have the [Web Speech API][w3c],
implemented in [most modern browsers][caniuse].
So, it's the ideal time to develop an easy to integrate Javascript wrapper
around the API — enter [simple-speak][npm].


<div class="demo">

<label>Speech input <input id="id-simple-speak" value="Hello. I'm simple-speak!"></label>

<div data-simple-speak='{ "voiceFamily": "Google UK English Female, Microsoft Anna - English (US), Kathy" }'></div>

</div>

It can be embedded on a page with 3 lines of HTML — including jQuery
(thanks to [unpkg][] and [RawGit][]):

```html
<div id="id-simple-speak"> Hello. I'm simple-speak. </div>

<script src="https://unpkg.com/jquery@2.2.4/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="{{ page.x-footer-script }}"></script>
```

The synthesiser can also be embedded via an `<iframe>`, and depending on
the capabilities of the browser, can speak in different languages.
(I haven't yet started to internationalize the user-interface.)
Here's an example in Spanish:

<div class="demo">

<iframe class="simple-speak-ifr" title="simple-speak" src=
  "{{ page.x-embed-url }}lang=es-ES;q={{ 'Buenos días. ¿cómo estás?' | cgi_escape | replace: '+', '%20' }}"
></iframe>

</div>

And, the source code for the above example:

```html
<iframe class="simple-speak-ifr" width="100%" height="75" src=
  "{{ page.x-embed-url }}lang=es-ES;q={{ 'Buenos días. ¿cómo estás?' | cgi_escape | replace: '+', '%20'  }}"
></iframe>
```

Here's a Mandarin Chinese synthesiser, in an `<iframe>`:

<iframe class="simple-speak-ifr" title="simple-speak" src=
  "{{ page.x-embed-url }}lang=zh-CN;q={{ '你好阿姨' | cgi_escape | replace: '+', '%20' }}"
></iframe>

### voiceFamily

A useful feature of `simple-speak` is the `voiceFamily` configuration property.
This property behaves a bit like [`font-family`][] in CSS, allowing an ordered,
comma-separated cross-platform list of synthesis voices to be listed.

In the following example, the synthesiser uses a Google voice on the Chrome browser,
falls back to a Microsoft voice on various browsers on Windows,
then falls back to a generic `female` voice if the first two options aren't available.

```html
<div data-simple-speak=
  '{ "voiceFamily": "Google UK English Female, Microsoft Anna - English (US), female" }'
></div>
```

So, in the same way as a designer lists a range of fonts available across different platforms,
you can list your preferred and fall-back voices.

```css
body {
  font-family: Helmet, Freesans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  /* CSS style: BBC */
}
```

View and contribute to this [spreadsheet of available voices][compat] ([get-voices][]).

### Use cases?

I'd love your ideas for how to harness the power of speech.
Some possible use cases for `simple-speak`:

1. As a component of online learning tools. For example, a re-boot of the [Moodle SimpleSpeak][mdl-p] [filter plugin][gh-mdl],
2. A site widget (a bit like [Google's translate your site service][gtrans]),
3. A browser extension,
4. An updated synthesiser for an '_in-browser_' screen-reader, such as [WebAnywhere][].
  ([GitHub][gh-wa])
  _(Currently the screen-reader appears to be broken — a real pity.)_


`simple-speak` is available via the [NPM registry][npm] and [GitHub][].

Go play!

## Update

### Spell me

15 June 2017 ~ I'm working on a spelling mode &hellip; <!-- It's not yet released, but here's a cheeky preview: -->

1 July 2017 ~ version [1.3.0 (beta) is released][rel].
It features a spelling mode, and triggers a custom message each time it starts to speak a phrase:

<iframe class="simple-speak-ifr" aria-label="Speech synthesis" src=
  "{{ page.x-embed-url }}mode=spell;rate=0.9&q=Spell%20me!"
></iframe>

Here's the HTML `<iframe>` source for the above spelling widget (`mode=spell`):

```html
<iframe class="simple-speak-ifr" aria-label="Speech synthesis" src=
  "{{ page.x-embed-url }}mode=spell;rate=0.9&q=Spell%20me!"
></iframe>
```
