I've had feedback that viewers may not understand our [entry for the Jisc Accessible by Design challenge][jisc-omp],
if they don't have a background in Web accessibility (or, words to that effect).

So, I thought I'd try to provide that introduction, and I'd relate it to where it
all started for me (I think) --
_[applied gerontology][nayak]_ and _[universal design][]_ at the University of Birmingham, circa 1997.

Exhibit A is this aerosol can -- for _Right Guard anti-perspirant_. Nothing special?
Well, if I turn it around, you may see an unusual, long aerosol button.
This should make the can easier to use for those with arthritis and other mobility impairments.

Exhibit B is this -- a _large print book_.
Together with embossed braille books, Daisy e-books and other formats, this can form part of a _universal design_ strategy to make books available to all.

Exhibit C is [Open Media Player][jisc-omp].
We'd like to add _timed_ or _synchronised transcripts_.
These would serve the needs of the hard of hearing, and any learners or others
who wish to quickly search and review a long video or audio track.
Synchronised transcripts would be another improvement on our journey towards universal design.
We already strive for keyboard and screen reader accessibility, and other forms of accessible design.
And, we seek to make an optimally accessible and usable online media player, that is open source.

Exhibit D is _[OpenSign][jisc-sign]_.
This is a proposal by three [H810 postgrads][H810] to create e-learning resources to teach sign language (BSL and others).
_OpenSign_ is a pragmatic and powerful step to open up communication between those with and without hearing impairments, reducing isolation, and increasing opportunities for all!
(_A much-needed idea, but not strictly universal design_.)

There are [many other great ideas in the Jisc competition][ideas].
Please take a look and help some of them get funding.

To summarise, universal design is about not designing for yourself
(in my case, white, male, young/middle-aged)!
Instead think about how you can open up your products and services to as many people as possible.
Useful steps: talk to "customers" from a wide range of demographics, and try a thought experiment -- _what might I need from everyday objects in 10, 20, 30 years time?_
