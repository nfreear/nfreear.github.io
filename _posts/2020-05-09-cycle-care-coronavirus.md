Inspired as I am, after getting back on my [bamboo bike][],
after a spot of re-building,
and reading [Peter Walker's "_Ten reasons …_"][10reasons],
and [Heidi Alexander's twitter thread][heidi_ldn],
here are is my two cents worth.

First, I'd love it if out of the tragedy of the Coronavirus,
some good can arise, in an increase in cycling for work, school and pleasure.

Here in [Milton Keynes][], we're blessed by an excellent network of _redway_ shared-use/cycle paths.
