Are you active on social media?
And, do you share and bookmark lots of links from the Web?
I certainly do.
One of the frustrations that I sometimes experience, is wanting to share a specific
phrase or paragraph part way down a long article or page, and not being able to.
(_As there isn't a convenient `id` nearby in the HTML_.)

This frustration led me to look at different ways of '_saving a place_' on a page.

Note, although what I'm talking about shares some similarities with [web annotation][search],
and social bookmarking, there are clear differences.

 1. I'd prefer something that you don't have to sign up to;
 2. Lightweight, without a server-based backend and database;
 3. Not reliant on a browser plugin or bookmarklet;
 4. Shareable and open-access;
 5. An approach that _fully acknowledges_ and doesn't distract from the source page **

The idea I've come up with encodes the URL of the source page, and the text to highlight like so,

```
https://scrolltotext.github.io/?url=http://example.org/page.html&text={Interesting+text}
```

And, you can optionally scroll to the _Nth_ occurrence of the text,

```
https://scrolltotext.github.io/?url=http://example.org/page.html&text={Interesting+text}&occurrence=2
```

It makes use of some recent HTML5 and DOM/JS innovations, including:

 * The [`Fetch API`][fetch api];
 * The [`srcdoc`][srcdoc] attribute;
 * [`scrollIntoView`][js-scroll]

The result uses pure HTML `+` Javascript (_no server-side scripting_), and acts as a _filtering_ [Web proxy][].

The main Javascript fetches the page at the given `URL`, searches for the `text`,
and injects some markup wrapping the text in the HTML (`<mark .. > ... </mark>`).
The HTML page is placed in a `srcdoc` attribute on an `<iframe>`,
with injection of a minimal quantity of CSS and Javascript (_approx. 28 lines of JS_).

The original page, plus highlighting is displayed in most modern browsers.
The browser smoothly scrolls to the highlighted text, and there are links to view the original page,
and to a disclaimer.

## Examples

Here are some examples which hopefully demonstrate the utility of the '_scroll-to-text_ prototype':

 * ['_To die, to sleep_', quote from Hamlet][hamlet]
 * ['_catch sight …_', quote from an OU News article][wels-tips]
 * [The 2nd occurrence of '_très_' in Descartes '_Les Principes de la Philosophie_' (French)][fr]

I envisage general use, plus application to things like e-learning.
I'd love feedback on this prototype, and I'm sure people out there have great use-cases.
