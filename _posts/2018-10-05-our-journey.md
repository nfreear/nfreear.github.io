I'm happy to say that a week ago, my colleague [Tim Coughlan][tim] flicked the switch,
to publish the code for [our-journey][] as an open-source project.

_our-journey_ started off as a [paper-based game][download], to be used in workshops,
and developed by Tim, [Kate Lister][kate] ([IET][]) and Glen Darby (_LTI Translation_).
(_You may be surprised at our track-record as a distance university, in using paper-based tools!_)
It allows a student to describe their journey through education, in terms of the highs and lows,
happiness, frustrations, stress and so on.
The student can chart not only the learning-related steps — writing essays, revising, group tutorials etc.,
but also _administrative_ steps like applying to university, and completing a _Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA)_ assessment, for example.

This can assist the student, tutors and support staff to work out where a problem might be,
and how to intervene to ensure success.
It has a firm [research][oro]-[based][oro-2] foundation.

The paper-based game has been turned into [an online activity][tool], by Tim (_with help from me_).

We've worked to make the code straightforward to understand, and maintainable.
Also to make it portable.
We've also started providing options for students to share their journeys.

There is a lot still to do, and we'd love your feedback and contributions.
