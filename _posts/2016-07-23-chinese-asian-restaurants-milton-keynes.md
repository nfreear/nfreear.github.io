We're quite fortunate in Milton Keynes to have a variety of independent
Chinese and Asian restaurants serving more _genuine_ cuisine.
Here are some suggestions, and below you'll find a handy map:

* [Taipan][] in the theatre district, serves a great dim sum breakfast/brunch,
  roughly 12~2pm at the weekends.
  They also do enjoyable hot pot dishes in the evening.
* Another reliable source of dim sum brunch [Kam Tong Garden][] in Great Holm.
* [Planet Dosa][] are a recent find in Oldbrook.
  They do delicious _pancakes_ from southern India and Sri Lanka.
* You'll need to journey to [Eat Saigon][] in Northampton for tasty Vietnamese cuisine.

Some notes,

* [dim sum][] are bite-size dumplings and other food, typically served for
  breakfast, in [Canton][] and other parts of China.
  They're a bit like Spanish tapas.
  Don't be put off by the form-like menu that you'll typically use to order food.
  If in doubt, ask for a menu with photos too!
* [Chinese dumplings][] can be steamed, boiled, shallow fried or grilled, and
  filled with meat, seafood, vegetables and tofu.
  Wonton are small dumplings served in soup;
* [congee][] is a Chinese porridge made from rice, and often containing
  preserved egg and meat, or served with side dishes;
* [dosa][] are a "_kind of pancake made from a fermented batter.
  Its main ingredients are rice and urad beans_ [black lentils]."
