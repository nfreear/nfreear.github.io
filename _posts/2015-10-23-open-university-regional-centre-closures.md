The news that the Open University plans to close seven out of its thirteen
regional centres in England made the national media.
In the wake of this, various Open University staff have written some insightful
pieces on what goes on at the regional centres.

They certainly opened my eyes.

I recommend that you do some reading around before forming an opinion.

<!--
There are perhaps two ways of looking at the planned closures.
Either our new Vice-Chancellor Peter Horrocks is showing wisdom and foresight,
and using his status as a _new broom_ to push through some much needed changes.
Or the senior management are short-sighted and should consult more with staff,
and particularly those in the front-line of student support.

You decide!
