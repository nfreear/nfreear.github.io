Way back in 2008, I had a new baby daughter, and I'd just joined the
[Institute of Educational Technology][iet], after a couple of rewarding years in
the VLE team at The Open University (_Learning and Teaching Solutions, LTS_).

I can't remember more context ... Suffice to say, I came across some animated GIFs
illustrating how to finger-spell using British Sign Language (_BSL_).
Some sites I looked at are [ian.barnsley][ar-jas-a] and [BritishSignLanguage.com][ar-brit-a].

I put together some PHP and Javascript code to use these GIF images to do finger-spelling _on demand_.
You can see the result at [`freear.org.uk/sign`][php].
As well as the core, there was a Javascript bookmarklet, and Greasemonkey user script.

I moved on to other projects, and the idea languished.
To preserve the code, I put it into [Bitbucket][] in 2011.

Press `Sign` to get started:

<div
  id="id-sign-machine"
  data-sign-machine='{ "initial": "Hi. I&apos;m sign-machine.", "dev": 0 }'
  >[ sign-machine requires Javascript. Is it disabled in your browser? ]</div>


I'm happy to say that I've revived the [`sign-machine` project on GitHub][gh].
Version 2.x is a complete re-write, without PHP, and with fresh Javascript.
It uses the same animated GIF images, and currently supports British Sign Language.

It can be embedded on a site with just three lines of HTML — the snippet uses jQuery 2.2.4:


```html
<div id="id-sign-machine"> Javascript is required. </div>

<script src="https://unpkg.co/jquery@2.2.4/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="{{ page.x-footer-script }}"></script>
```

There are more [usage examples][usage].
You can also try with a [`sign` parameter in the URL][query].

I'd love some feedback on this idea.
Is it sane, and can you think of potential uses?
Would you like to see it in your language?
American/ French/ Swedish ... Sign Language?
Would you like it extended beyond finger-spelling?
