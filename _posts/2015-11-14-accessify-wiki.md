This post is lo-o-oong overdue!

I started development on the prototype Accessify Wiki on [14 April 2013][] and paused work on 1 June 2014.
And really, its high time I tried to explain just what it's for and how it works...


## Raison d'être

Accessibility guidelines and technical standards, outreach and education,
and partnership with those who develop web sites and services that contain accessibility problems.
These are all good, valuable approaches to tackling Web accessibility.
However, there are times when these efforts don't produce the desired result.

A web site owner may be willing to fix accessibility problems, but want to
put the issues into the next re-design in 6 months time.
A site owner may simply prove unresponsive, but end-users still need to use the service in question.
Or, a developer may wish to use a third-party library, recognises that it contains issues,
but doesn't have time to collaborate on fixing the library in their current project
(this last issue is one that I face as a developer on fast-paced research projects).

We can summarize these potential problems as:

* Lack of _willingness_,
* _Timeliness_,
* _Dependency_ on third-party libraries and services,

Given the challenges, I've been looking for a creative, pragmatic solution that
would build on and compliment the existing approaches to fixing accessibility on the Web.

## Anatomy of a fix

Suppose we have the following snippet of HTML on a page — an image that when
pressed using a mouse closes a dialog box within the page, via Javascript.

### HTML before
{% highlight html linenos %}
<img
  src="close-button.png"
  onclick="closeDialog()"
/>
{% endhighlight %}


There are various accessibility issues with the above HTML snippet, so below is an imaginary fix,
written in [YAML][] on the Accessify Wiki.

### The fix
{% highlight yaml linenos %}
_CONFIG_:
    include:
        - http://example.org/*
    test_urls:
        - http://example.org/test-page-1.html

img[ src *= close-button ]:
    tabindex: 0
    role: button
    alt: Close dialog

# Another fix
# ...
{% endhighlight %}


[Line one](#L2-1) defines a `_CONFIG_` object, with two required entries, `include` and `test_urls`.
`include` contains one or more URL patterns (_glob_ syntax), specifying
the set of pages on which these fix(es) should be applied.
`test_urls` defines one or more URLs to specific pages that can be used to test the fixes.

[Line 7](#L2-7) contains a _selector_ as used in CSS stylesheets, jQuery and other contexts.
In this case it says, select images whose `src` attribute contains the text string `close-button`.
Lines 8–10 define three attributes that need to be added to the selected HTML elments:
`tabindex`, `role` and `alt` (_ALT-ernative text_), and there respective values.



Note, as [the fix is written in YAML][p], we can dispense with most (almost all), of the
quote characters used in JSON, making the result more readable.


### HTML after

When the fix is [injected via Javascript](#anatomy-of-a-system), it results in the following HTML:


{% highlight html linenos %}
<img
  src="close-button.png"
  onclick="closeDialog()"
  tabindex="0"
  role="button"
  alt="Close dialog"
/>
{% endhighlight %}

* A `tabindex` of `0` allows keyboard users to navigate to the button using the _TAB_ key,
* A `role` of `button` allows screen readers like JAWS to announce this element as a button, and
* The `alt` attribute describes to the user what action will be taken by pressing the button.

Our image that looks like a button, now _feels_ like a button
(or as [WCAG 2.0][] says, it is "_perceivable, operable, usable_ and _robust_" — _POUR_).

Fix complete!

And, to stress the fix has been implemented without access to the server hosting this example page.
It is implemented via a third-party service, and integrated into the page on a per-user basis, via an add-on, browser extension or similar technology, within the user's browser.

In future posts I'll discuss the anatomy of the Accessify Wiki software system,
and the relationship of Accessify Wiki to so-called _accessibility middleware_.
